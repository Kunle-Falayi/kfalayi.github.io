                                  <h2>Dollar stores would make the perfect vaccination sites in Georgia</h2>
                                <p>I love QGIS, but I would admit some of the features are still less intuitive for me to use. 
                                I think I'll get there though. This is perhaps one of the most complicated maps I have ever made. 
                                It may not look it, but it wasn't as easy as other maps I have made previously. Some internal calculations here, 
                                API key use there, I finally produced what you are looking at.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I decided to recreate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-citylab-covid-vaccines-dollar-store-locations/#:~:text=Toni%20Young%2C%20co%2Dfounder%20of,covered%20with%20thousands%20of%20dots.">this</a> Bloomberg map on a different state - Georgia. To make it easier to understand, I limited my variables (layers), to just two;
                                vaccination sites and location of within 10 mins drive of dollar stores.
                                </p>
                                <p>Georgia has 411 vaccination sites and 1,322 dollar stores.</p>
