                                   chocolate market. I went to the cocoa producing region of Ghana in this TV report for the BBC to find out why
                                   and what the country is doing about this. Scripting, camera directing, drone piloting and video editing done by me.

                                   <p>Young Africans are transitioning to more formal investment clubs. How do these work exactly?
                                      At 43 percent, financial inclusion is still low in sub-Saharan Africa despite the recent increase 
                                      due to mobile money services. This is a BBC TV story in which I explore how Africa's emerging investment clubs work
                                      and what impact it is having on the ability of young people to create wealth.

                                   <p>I have always loved animated visualizations. I did this for the web version of a newspaper feature story I
                                        wrote about Nigeria's rice consumption. My aim was to compare Nigeria to another rice producing country - 
                                        Brazil - in terms of rice production and consumption capacity to. I don't know, you think this makes sense?
